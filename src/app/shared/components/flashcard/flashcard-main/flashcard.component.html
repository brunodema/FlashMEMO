  <!-- So, what is going on here... My goals are:
              (1) centralize the input method buttons (image, sound, text, whatever), while also making them visually appealing (as round as possible, pretty borders, etc)
              (2) distribute the rows EVENLY without gutters... the reason for this is to not waste any space later for images/text/sound/etc
              Class 'flex-fill' is used (in children components) to replicate the behavior of things such as 'col', but for vertical space
              Class 'd-flex has to be used for the 'align' and 'justify' directives to work there (this stuff can be seen inside the child component)
